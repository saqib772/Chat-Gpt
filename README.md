# Chat-GPT A Step By step Guide
Chatting with ChatGPT is fun and informative — I’ve been chit-chatting with it for past time and exploring some new ideas to learn. But these are more casual use cases and the novelty can quickly wean off, especially when you realize that it can generate hallucinations.

How might we use it in a more productive way? With the recent release of the GPT 3.5 series API by OpenAI, we can do much more than just chit-chatting. One very productive use case for businesses and your personal use is QA (Question Answering) — you ask the bot in natural language about your own documents/data, and it can quickly answer you by retrieving info from the documents and generating a response . You can use it for customer support, synthesizing user research, your personal knowledge management, and more!

First of All You have to Make OpenAI account. simply go their website and signup just.

Now on The Top Right of your profile just Click The View API Keys and then create a new secret key to get Open AI API key. You Nailed it Dear Alien.

You Need Now IDE I will prefer Visual studio Code if you don’t have download from Google or from any other search engine. Then You Need To install The python in Your machine and a python extension in Visual studio Code.


Just Copy paste The code in first File in your IDE and run it but wait before Running Make sure You Installed openai Library by Just running command of pip install openai and it will automatically install all relative libraries.
Explanation of the code:

First, the code imports the OpenAI library by typing “import openai”. This library provides access to OpenAI’s language models and other AI-powered tools.

Next, the code sets the OpenAI API key to a specific value. The API key is a unique identifier that allows the code to access OpenAI’s services. In this case, the key is set to a string of characters that represents a specific user’s access to the OpenAI API.

After that, the code calls the “create” method of the “ChatCompletion” class provided by the OpenAI library. This method generates a response to a chat message using the specified language model. In this case, the model being used is called “gpt-3.5-turbo”.

The “create” method takes two arguments: “model” and “messages”. The “model” argument specifies the name of the language model to use, and the “messages” argument is a list of dictionaries that represent the chat messages to be responded to.

In this case, the “messages” list contains a single dictionary with two key-value pairs. The “role” key specifies whether the message is from the user or the AI, and the “content” key contains the actual text of the message. The user’s message is “Give me 3 Astronomical events in 2023”.

Finally, the code prints out the response generated by the “create” method. The response is contained within the “choices” list, and the actual text of the response is accessed using the “.message.content” syntax.

## Now Go To Second File copy paste the  code which can remember The History of chats when you give The prompts.
First, the code imports the OpenAI library by typing “import openai”. This library provides access to OpenAI’s language models and other AI-powered tools.

Next, the code sets the OpenAI API key to a specific value. The API key is a unique identifier that allows the code to access OpenAI’s services. In this case, the key is set to a string of characters that represents a specific user’s access to the OpenAI API.

After that, the code creates an empty list called “messages”. This list will be used to store the messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot.

The code then prompts the user to input what type of chatbot they would like to create. This message is stored in a variable called “system_msg”. The code appends this message to the “messages” list, with the role of “system” (i.e., the chatbot system) and the content of the user’s message.

The code then prints out a message indicating that the chatbot is ready to use.

The code then enters a loop that will continue until the user inputs “quit()”. In each iteration of the loop, the code prompts the user to input a message. This message is stored in a variable called “message”. The code appends this message to the “messages” list, with the role of “user” and the content of the user’s message.

The code then uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to the user’s message. It does this by calling the “create” method of the “ChatCompletion” class provided by the OpenAI library. This method generates a response using the specified language model. In this case, the model being used is called “gpt-3.5-turbo”.

The response generated by the “create” method is stored in a variable called “response”. The code then extracts the actual text of the response from the “response” variable using the “choices” list and the “.message.content” syntax. The response is stored in a variable called “reply”.

The code then appends the response to the “messages” list, with the role of “assistant” and the content of the chatbot’s response.

Finally, the code prints out the chatbot’s response and starts a new line.
